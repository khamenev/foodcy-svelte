		Embark on a gastronomic adventure with me, where we spill the beans (and occasionally the
		tzatziki ğŸ¥’) on Cyprus's culinary hotspots. Our site is your trusty guide, leading both locals and
		tourists to the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me of Cypriot eateries. From secret spots where grandmas cook
		better than Michelin-starred chefs to trendy terraces where the cocktails are as stunning as the
		sunsets, we've got your cravings covered. Join us as we unearth the best bites in Cyprus â€“ it's
		a delicious journey, forks and knives at the ready!
