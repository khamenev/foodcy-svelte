## What
A spot that quickly became your go-to for adding a joyous 10 kilos. Picture this: the most mouth-watering souvlaki you've ever tasted, scrumptious potatoes, unbeatable prices in Limassol, long opening hours, and generous helpings. Essentially, it's every Cypriot's dream diner.
## Must
Here's a tip: try the potatoes with tzatziki sauce. Fair warning, though ‚Äì it might just make you a Cyprus addict. And their pita with chicken souvlaki, wrapped in bacon and topped with feta, is a one-way ticket to culinary paradise (and a few extra kilos). Oh, and you can't leave without trying the bacon-wrapped halloumi. 
If you've still got room, and don't mind adding a bit more weight, their salads are a delight, especially the Caesar or the one with local cheese ü•ó.

P.S. Always take a Greek size portion, it is enough even for several people.
