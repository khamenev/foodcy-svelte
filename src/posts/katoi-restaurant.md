## What
A hidden gem in the mountains 🏞️, a nemesis for small appetites 😅, and a place so popular you must book in advance (and it's hard to leave) 📖🚪. First, you'll feast your eyes on the breathtaking natural beauty and village charm (don't forget to check out the monastery's museums) 🌳🏰. Then, get ready to indulge in traditional dishes cooked to perfection - a tribute to all who've suffered through overcooked tourist-trap meats 🍖👏.
## Must
Opt for the meat meze, which is meant for two but could easily satisfy a party of five and a pack of local stray cats.
