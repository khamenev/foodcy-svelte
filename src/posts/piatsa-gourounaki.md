## What
If Zeus were real, he'd probably ditch Olympus and move to Cyprus just for this place. With prices so friendly, even Limassol locals are quietly green with envy. Expect traditional service with a cheeky side of after-meal spirits, and meat so tender it practically serenades your taste buds. Brace yourself for gigantic portions in a room buzzing with joy and the finest Cypriot dishes this side of the Mediterranean.
## Must
The mustard-coated chicken thighs here are not just food; they're a journey in every bite. And don't even get me started on the Felafelaki and chicken kebab with giaourtlou sauce. They're so good, you might just find yourself filling out residency papers to stay in Cyprus forever!
