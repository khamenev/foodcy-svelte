## What
Who said that brunches aren't made in back alleys? Who said that back alleys can't become fashionable courtyards with fabulous brunches? Introducing a place for early and late breakfast, as well as lunch, that will surprise you with its dishes. The key is to find it in a not-so-obvious location.
## Must
You definitely should try dishes filled with local color like "The Stoa Eyes" and "The Farmer" but other dishes will also easily satisfy and make this place a favorite.
